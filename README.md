👋 Hi, I’m a PhD student at Imperial College London in the Department of Computing, supervised by Maja Pantic and Björn Schuller in IBUG (Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group). I will be submitting my thesis and finishing my PhD in January 2023.

🖥️ I spent a substantial portion of my PhD interning and working at Meta AI, where I collaborated with multiple teams and developed my PhD research. 

📚 I completed my BSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico and my MSc in Advanced Computing at Imperial College London.

🔬🤖 My research is focused on deep learning applied to audio-visual speech (i.e., faces, lip movements and speech). In particular, I am interested in applying self-supervised learning to learn from unlabelled audio-visual speech. I am also interested and have experience in generative modelling, particularly in generating speech using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

🗣️ I have given live talks about my research in multiple conferences including CVPR, Interspeech and ICASSP. I also engage with the machine learning online community directly through platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.

🎸🎾 During my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and bass (usually with a band). I also play squash with my colleagues from Imperial College London on a weekly basis.
