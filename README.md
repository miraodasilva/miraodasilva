👋 Hi, my name is Rodrigo and I’m a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in New York City. Before that, I was as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Meta working on new approaches for generative modeling and self-supervised learning on audio-visual speech. At Meta, my main project was Automated Dubbing for Instagrams Reels, where I worked on speech-driven facial animation/lip synchronization.

📚 I completed my BSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, as well as my MSc and PhD in Computing at Imperial College London.

🖥️ I spent a substantial portion of my PhD interning and working at Meta AI, where I collaborated with multiple teams and developed my PhD research. I also joined Sony R&D in Tokyo briefly after completing my PhD, as a research intern, where I worked on video-to-audio generation.

🔬🤖 My research is focused on deep learning applied to audio-visual speech (i.e., faces, lip movements, and speech). In particular, I am interested in applying self-supervised learning to learn from unlabelled audio-visual speech. I am also interested and have experience in generative modeling, particularly in generating speech using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models.
